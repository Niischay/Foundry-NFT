# Solidity Smart Contracts for NFTs

This repository contains Solidity smart contracts for Basic NFTs and Mood NFTs, along with code snippets for deploying and interacting with these contracts.

## Basic NFTs

### Overview

The Basic NFTs contract allows users to create and manage non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing unique digital assets.

### Deployment

To deploy the Basic NFTs contract, use the following steps:

1. Compile the contract using Solidity compiler version 0.8.20.
2. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain using a tool like Remix or Hardhat.

### Interacting with Basic NFTs

Once deployed, you can interact with the Basic NFTs contract using the following methods:

- Mint NFT: Create a new NFT with unique metadata.
- Transfer NFT: Transfer ownership of an NFT to another address.
- Get NFT Details: Retrieve metadata and owner information for a specific NFT.

## Mood NFTs

### Overview

The Mood NFTs contract extends the Basic NFTs functionality to include mood attributes for each NFT.

### Deployment

Deploying the Mood NFTs contract follows similar steps to the Basic NFTs contract deployment:

1. Compile the contract with Solidity compiler version 0.8.20.
2. Deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

### Interacting with Mood NFTs

After deployment, interact with the Mood NFTs contract using these methods:

- Set Mood: Set the mood attribute for a specific NFT.
- Get Mood: Retrieve the mood attribute for an NFT.
- Transfer NFT: Transfer ownership of a mood-enabled NFT.

## Examples

Check out the code snippets in this repository for example Solidity code on deploying, minting, transferring, and managing NFTs using the Basic NFTs and Mood NFTs contracts.
